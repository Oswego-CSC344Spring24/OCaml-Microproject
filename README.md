# OCaml-Microproject

Begin with the code from the class example featuring a recursive descent parser in OCaml. That program implements a tokenizer and parser for the following grammar:
```OCaml
E -: A '+' E | A
A -: 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
```

The parser, when provided with a list of typed tokens, builds an [Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)]() featuring Sum and Num nodes. The Sum nodes are pairs of nodes which are to be added, and Num nodes have integer values. It also implements evaluation for ASTs generated by the parser. Modify the program to implement the following, modified grammar:
```OCaml

E -: T '+' E | T
T -: A '*' T | A
A -: [0-9]+

```


Note that the A value is provided in terms of a regular expression, allowing for 1 or more of 0-9. Be sure the tokenizer, parser, and evaluation components all work. You will need to modify the token and exp types, the tokenizer, the parser, and the evaluation.

When you submit your microproject, please include both your code and a screenshot of your code producing reasonable output.
